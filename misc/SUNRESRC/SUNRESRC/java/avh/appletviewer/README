Hi,

For better instructions on how to use the AppletViewer class
check out:

	http://java.sun.com/people/avh/appletviewer.html

Examples:

	java AppletViewer doc:/demo/ class=AudioItem snd=audio/spacemusic.au

	java AppletViewer http://java.sun.com/people/avh/ \
	     class=DateItem translator=EnglishTime speaker=avh \
	     width=150 height=35

The code was last updated on the 5th of July 1995. Among other things
this fixes a problem with mouseMove and mouseDrag events. There is a known
bug with regard to resize() in the alpha2 and alph3 releases of HotJava. 

Have fun,

	Arthur van Hoff
