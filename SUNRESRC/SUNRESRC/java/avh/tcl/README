Hi,

This directory contains a prototype of how you could
interface Tcl to Java. This code was originally written
by Patrick Naughton (naughton@starwave.com) and has only
been slightly modified since.

The source for Tcl is not included. You'll have to get
that somewhere in order to build it from scratch. However,
I have included the Solaris libraries so you can try it out. 

Try this:

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	java TclTest

and you should see the output of some Tcl code being
executed from Java.

PS: We don't support this stuff. It is just there as a demo
of how to interface between Tcl and Java.

Have fun,
