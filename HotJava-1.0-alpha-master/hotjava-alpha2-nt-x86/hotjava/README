This directory and all the directories below it contain the
complete HotJava 1.0alpha2 and the Java language 1.0alpha2 binary
release for Windows NT.

The primary goal of this Alpha release is to allow people to try the
various demos and to write their own Java applets.  This Alpha
release of HotJava is not intended to replace your favorite browser
for daily web surfing.  See http://java.sun.com/KnownBugs-nt.html for
a list of known bugs in the Alpha 2 Windows NT release.

Requirements for running Java/HotJava Alpha2 on Windows NT:

    - An Intel x86-based machine running Windows NT 3.5.
      HotJava Alpha 2 for Windows NT is known not to run on 
      NT 3.51 when audio is enabled.
  
      See http://java.sun.com/installation-alpha2-nt-x86.html
      for details.

    - A 16-bit SoundBlaster.  HotJava may work on other
      SoundBlaster compatibles but we haven't tested any.
      Also, HotJava does not yet support 8-bit audio.

    - 8-bit color.  Support for 1,4,16,24-bit color is forthcoming.

Java and HotJava are available without a fee for non-commercial use
(academic, research and internal business purposes).  Commercial
licensing terms will be announced in coming months.

To execute HotJava from the same directory when this README file
is location, simply type:
 
        bin\hotjava
 
You can also add <installation-dir>\bin to your path if you choose.
 
The group working on HotJava at Sun currently has ports to MacOS
and Windows 95 underway.  We are interested in hearing from
qualified individuals or groups who want to port the system to
other platforms.  Contact us at java@java.sun.com before starting
any porting effort.  We would like to offer assistance where we
can and prevent duplication of effort.
 
If you have questions or comments about HotJava or the Java
language we would like to hear from you.

Please indicate that you are using the 1.0alpha2 for NT version of the
software when you write.
