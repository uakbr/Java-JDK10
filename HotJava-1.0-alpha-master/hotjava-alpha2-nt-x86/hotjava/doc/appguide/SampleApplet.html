SampleApplet is useful
for seeing how events are handled
and when methods are invoked.
It prints debugging messages 
to standard output.

Now move the mouse within and near the SampleApplet display.
See what happens when you press a mouse button.
Try going to another page and then returning.
Try pressing the reload button
