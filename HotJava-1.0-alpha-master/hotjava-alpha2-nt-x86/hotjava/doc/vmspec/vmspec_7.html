The registers of the Java virtual machine maintain machine state during its operation. They are directly analogous to the registers of a microprocessor. The Java virtual machine's registers include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>pc -- the Java program counter<P>
<LI>optop -- a pointer to the top of the Java operand stack<P>
<LI>frame -- a pointer to the execution environment of the currently executing method<P>
<LI>vars -- a pointer to the 0th local variable of the currently executing method<P>
</UL>
The Java virtual machine defines each of its registers to be 32 bits wide. Some Java implementations may not use all of these registers: e.g. a compiler from Java source to native code does not maintain pc.<P>
The Java virtual machine is stack-based, so it does not define or use registers for passing or receiving parameters. This is again a conscious decision in favor of instruction set simplicity and compactness, and efficient implementation on host processors without many registers (e.g. Intel 486).<P>
