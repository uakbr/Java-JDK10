<H1>1  Correspondence between Java Types and C Types</H1>
<HR>


The following table shows the correspondence between types in Java and types in C.<P>
There are two places that you will see Java types exposed in C, inside of structures made to map over Java instances and as arguments to C routines. For the most part these two uses reflect the same correspondence between Java types and C types. The most notable difference between Java types and C types are with Java arrays.<BR><IMG SRC="rpi-appendix_Tbl_9.gif"><BR>
