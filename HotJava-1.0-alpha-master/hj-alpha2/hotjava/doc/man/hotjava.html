<H1>HotJava - The JAVA World Wide Web Browser</H1>
HotJava allows browsing of the World Wide Web and provides the 
ability to present interactive content across platforms. Interactive
content is in the form of applets. Applets are programs written in the
JAVA language to run within HotJava.
<p>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
hotjava [ url ]
<p>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
The <b>hotjava</b> command starts the HotJava browser and connects to the 
document or resource  designated by <I>url</I>. If <I>url</I> is not supplied 
then HotJava goes to either:
<ul>
<li>
the page designated by the value of the environment variable WWW_HOME; or
<li>
<code>file://~/demo</code> if WWW_HOME is unset.
</ul>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>
<dl>
<dt>HOTJAVA_HOME
<dd>The directory where HotJava looks for resources that it needs to run
itself. By default this is set to the installation directory when the 
system is first installed.
<dt>WWW_HOME
<dd>The default home page.
<a name=HOTJAVA_READ_PATH><dt>HOTJAVA_READ_PATH</a>
<dd>Used by HotJava to determine whether any applet
has permission read a file. The value of HOTJAVA_READ_PATH is a 
colon-separated list of files or directories. By default HOTJAVA_READ_PATH
is set to:
<pre>
     &lt;hotjava-install-dir&gt;:$HOME/public_html/
</pre>
Each component of the path is used as a prefix to compare 
against the file that the applet wants to open for reading. Applets are 
allowed to read from 
<ul>
<li>files in matching directories 
<li>files in subdirectories of matching directories
<li>files that match a component exactly
</ul>
<p>
For example, let's say you have a directory:
<pre>
     $HOME/Images
</pre>
<p>
As subdirectories under "Images" you have a "Private" subdirectory and a
"Public" subdirectory. If you set HOTJAVA_READ_PATH to:
<pre>
     &lt;hotjava-install-dir&gt;:$HOME/public_html/:$HOME/Images/
</pre>
<p>
an applet would be able to read the "Private" subdirectory. If you wanted to
prevent applets from reading the "Private" subdirectory but allow them to
read the "Public" one  then you would set HOTJAVA_READ_PATH to:
<pre>
     &lt;hotjava-install-dir&gt;:$HOME/public_html/:$HOME/Images/Public/
</pre>
<p>
In this way the directory "$HOME/Images/Private" won't match any component of
HOTJAVA_READ_PATH and applets can't read files in it.
<p>
Setting HOTJAVA_READ_PATH to "*" disables file checking for reads. The
* should be quoted so the shell doesn't expand it.
<p>
<dt>HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH
<dd>Used by HotJava to determine whether an applet has permission
to write to a file. The value of HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH is a 
colon-separated list of files or directories. By default HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH
is set to:
<pre>
     /tmp/:/devices/:/dev/:~/.hotjava/
</pre>
The components of the path are used as a prefix to 
compare 
against the file that the applet wants to open for writing.
<p>
See <a href="hotjava.html#HOTJAVA_READ_PATH">HOTJAVA_READ_PATH</a>
for an example of how matching components works. The
* should be quoted so the shell doesn't expand it.
<p>
Setting HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH to "*" disables file checking for writes.
