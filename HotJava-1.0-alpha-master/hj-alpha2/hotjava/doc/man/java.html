<h1> java-The Java Interpreter</h1>
java interprets (executes) Java bytecodes.
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
java [ <a href="java.html#Options">options</a> ] classname &lt;args&gt;
<P>
java_g [ <a href="java.html#Options">options</a> ] classname &lt;args&gt;
<P>
</pre>
<P>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>java</b> is the Java interpreter, which executes Java programs.
<P>
The <i>classname</i> argument is the name of a class.  
<i>classname</i> must be fully qualifed by including its package in the name, 
for example:
<pre>
    java java.lang.String
</pre>
<p>
Note that any arguments that are after <i>classname</i> in the call to 
java are passed to the class.
<p>
The bytecodes for the class are in a file called <i>classname.class</i> 
generated 
by compiling the corresponding class source file with <b>javac</b>. All Java 
bytecode 
files have .class as their extension, which the compiler automatically adds 
when the 
class is compiled. <i>classname</i> must contain a  <code>main()</code> 
method, which 
<b>java</b> executes and then exits, unless <code>main()</code> 
creates one or more threads. If any threads are created by <code>main()</code>
then <b>java</b> doesn't exit until the last thread exits. The 
<code>main()</code> method is defined as follows:
<pre>
    class Aclass {
        public static void main(String argv[]){ 
            < main code >
        }
    }
</pre>
When you define your own classes you need to specify their location. 
Use CLASSPATH to do this. 
CLASSPATH consists of a colon separated list of directories that specifies the 
path. 
For example:<P>
<pre>
    .:/home/avh/classes
</pre>
Note that the system always appends the location of the system classes
onto the end of the class path unless you use the <i>-classpath</i> option to 
specify a path.
<p>
Ordinarily, source files are compiled using <b>javac</b> then the program is 
run 
using <b>java</b>. However, <b>java</b> can be used to compile and run 
programs when the 
<i>-cs</i> option is used. As each class is loaded its modification date is compared
to the modification date of the class source file. If the source has been 
modified more recently, it is recompiled and the new bytecode file is loaded. 
<b>java</b> repeats this procedure until all the classes are correctly compiled
and loaded.
<p>
The interpreter can determine whether a class is legitimate through the 
mechanism of verification. Verification ensures that the byte
codes being interpreted do not violate any language constraints.

<P>
<b>java_g</b> is a non-optimized version of <b>java</b> suitable for use with 
debuggers like dbx or gdb.

<dl>
<dt> -cs, -checksource
<dd> When a compiled class is loaded, causes the modification time of the 
class bytecode file to be compared to that of the class source file. If the 
source has been modified more recently, it is recompiled and the new bytecode 
file is loaded.<P>
<dt>-classpath path
<dd> Specifies the path <b>java</b> uses to look up classes. Overrides the default 
or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is set. Directories are separated by 
colons. Thus the general format for <i>path</i> is:
<pre>
    .:&lt;your_path&gt;
</pre>
<p>
For example:
<pre>
    .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
</pre>
<dt>-ms <i>x</i>
<dd>Sets the size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected heap) 
to <i>x</i>. The default units for <i>x</i> are bytes. <i>x</i> must 
be &gt; 1000 bytes. 
You can 
modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either the letter &quot;k&quot; 
for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes.
The default is &quot;-ms3m", for 3 megabytes of memory.<P>
<dt>-noasyncgc
<dd>Turns off asynchronous garbage collection. When passed as an option no 
garbage collection takes place unless it is explicitly called or the program 
runs out of memory. Normally garbage collection runs as an asynchronous 
thread in parallel with other threads.<P>
<dt>-prof
<dd>Causes <b>java</b> to produce profiling data. When used, <b>java</b>
creates a file called "java.prof" in the current directory, when
it exits. This file can be passed to <a href="javaprof.html"><b>javaprof</b></a> for prettyprinting.
<dt>-ss <i>x</i>
<dd>Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.
The -ss option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by C code 
in a thread to <i>x</i>. Every thread that is spawned during the execution of
the program passed to
<b>java</b> has <i>x</i> as its C stack size. The default units for <i>x</i>
 are bytes. <i>x</i> must be 
&gt; 1000 bytes. You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either 
the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for 
megabytes.
The default stack size is 64 kilobytes ("-ss 64k").<p>
<dt>-oss <i>x</i>
<dd>Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.
The -oss option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by Java code 
in a thread to <i>x</i>.
Every thread that is spawned during the execution of the program passed to
<b>java</b> has <i>x</i> as its Java stack size. The default 
units for <i>x</i> are bytes. <i>x</i> must be 
&gt; 1000 bytes. You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either 
the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for 
megabytes.
The default stack size is 400 kilobytes ("-ss400k").<p>
<dt>-t    
<dd>Prints a trace of the instructions executed ( <b>java_g</b> only).<p>
<dt>-v, -verbose
<dd>Causes <b>java</b> to print a message to stdout each time a class file is 
loaded.<P>
<dt>-verify
<dd>Runs the verifier on all code.
<p>
<dt>-verifyremote
<dd>Runs the verifier on all code that is loaded into the system via a
classloader. <i>verifyremote</i> is the default for the interpreter.
<p>
<dt>-noverify
<dd>Turns verification off.
<p>
<dt>-verbosegc
<dd>Causes the garbage collector to print out messages whenever it frees 
memory.<P>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<dl>
<dt>CLASSPATH
<dd>Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons, for example,
<pre>
    .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
</pre>
</dl>
