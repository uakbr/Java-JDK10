<H3>Configurable converter of FrameMaker documents to the World-Wide Web 
</H3>
<HR>
<P>The combination of WebMaker and FrameMaker enables you to publish
simultaneously both the printed and the WWW versions of a document.
WebMaker converts FrameMaker documents and books to a hypertext network 
of HTML files that may be viewed by World-Wide Web browsers 
such as Mosaic. 
<P>WWW is a global hypertext information network 
conceived at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. 

<P>WebMaker translates FrameMaker entities such as imported and native 
graphics, mathematics, tables, figures, anchored frames, cross-references,
character highlights, indices and footnotes. 
It generates tables of contents automatically,
and transforms into graphical images elements that are unknown to HTML.
The user has control over a number of conversion aspects:
<UL>
<LI> the rules for the breakup of the Frame document into the component HTML 
files;
<LI> a panel of hypertext links to facilitate navigation within the WWW 
documents web;
<LI> the rules for the mapping of paragraph and character formats to HTML 
constructs;
<LI> the specification of material for selective inclusion in the FrameMaker 
or WWW document.
