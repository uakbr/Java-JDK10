There are two differences between this format and the "standard" UTF format. First, the null byte (0x00) is encoded as two bytes rather than as one byte, so that strings never have embedded nulls. Second, only the one-byte, two-byte, and three-byte formats are used. We do not recognize the longer formats.<P>
