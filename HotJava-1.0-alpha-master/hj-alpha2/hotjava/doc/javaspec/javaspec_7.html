<A NAME=MARKER2_1></A><A NAME=MARKER2_2></A>Packages are groups of classes and interfaces. They are a tool for managing a large namespace and avoiding conflicts. Every class and interface name is contained in some package. By convention, package names consist of period-separated words, with the first name representing the organization that developed the package.<P>

<H3> 6.1  Specifying a Compilation Unit's Package</H3>
The package that a compilation unit is in is specified by a <A NAME=MARKER2_3></A>package statement. When this statement is present, it must be the first non-comment, non-white space line in the compilation unit. It has the following format:<P>
<PRE>
package packageName;
</PRE>
When a compilation unit has no package statement, the unit is placed in a default package, which has no name.<P>

<H3> 6.2  <A NAME=4>Using Classes and Interfaces from Other Packages</H3>
The language provides a mechanism for making the definitions and implementations of classes and interfaces available across packages. The import keyword is used to mark classes as being imported into the current package. A compilation unit automatically imports every class and interface in its own package.<P>
Code in one package can specify classes or interfaces from another package in one of two ways:<P>
<UL>
<LI>By prefacing each reference to the class or interface name with the name of its package:<P>
</UL>
<PRE>

         // prefacing with a package<P>
         acme.project.FooBar obj = new acme.project.FooBar();<P>

</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>By importing the class or interface or the package that contains it, using an import statement. Importing a class or interface makes the name of the class or interface available in the current namespace. <A NAME=MARKER2_5></A>Importing a package makes the names of all of its public classes and interfaces available. The construct:<P>
</UL>
<PRE>

         // import all classes from acme.project<P>
         import acme.project.*;<P>
<P>
means that every public class from acme.project is imported.<P>
The following construct imports a single class, Employee_List, from the acme.project package:<P>

         // import Employee_List from acme.project<P>
         import acme.project.FooBar;<P>
         Employee_List obj = new Employee_List();<P>
</PRE>
It is illegal to specify an ambiguous class name and doing so always generates a compile-time error. Class names may be disambiguated through the use of a fully qualified class name, i.e., one that includes the name of the class's package.<P>
