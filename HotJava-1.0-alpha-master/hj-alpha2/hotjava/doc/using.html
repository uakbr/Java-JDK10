<h1><a name=features>Features</a></h1> 


The HotJava Internet Browser offers the following features: <dl>
<dt><b><a name=content>Runs Executable Content</a></b> <dd>
<dd>HotJava can run executable content in the form of "applets" --
programs written in the Java language with an API designed especially to run within
HotJava.  We provide several applets, including one that you can use
to put <A Href="../doc/appguide/Animation.html">animation</A> in a
page, and another that plays <A
Href="../doc/appguide/Sound.html">sounds</A>.  For more information on
applets, see <a href="../doc/appguide/index.html">Writing and Using
HotJava Applets</a>.

<p><dt><b><a name=security></a>Provides Network Security</b><dd>Applets may not write to or change your files in any way. On top of this basic security, you may further restrict the capabilities of incoming content. These options are configured by selecting <a href="#security_options">Security... </a>from the Options menu in the HotJava menu bar.

<p><dt><b><a name=threads></a>Multithreaded Applications</b><dd>The
Java language is multi-threaded. You will notice this when browsing
HTML pages because HotJava can fetch multiple images at the same
time. You can also start browsing immediately, while HotJava is
fetching images. Try scrolling some of our demos as they are running
or printing an applet as it is running!

<p><dt><b><a name=delay> Delayed Image and
Applet Loading</a></b><dd>You can elect to load images and applets
"lazily" -- that is only when you click on them. HotJava also features incremental image
loading.Web pages display incrementally as they are loading and can be
scrolled while they are still being fetched. Special <a href="#status">status icons </a>indicate the 
status of the image or applet.

<p><dt><b><a name=extensions></a> Supports Most Netscape
Extensions</b><dd>HotJava supports all of the Netscape HTML
extensions to the IMG and HR tags except left and right.

<p><dt><b><a name=protocols></a> Supports Major Internet
Protocols</b><dd>HotJava supports the major Internet transfer
protocols. The tool supports HTTP and HTTPD, news,
mailto, and ftp browsing. (Support for Gopher will be added in afuture release.) <p>

<dl> <dt> <b>news:</b><dd>To access your news reader, type the URL "news:" 
 in the Document URL text area. To access a news group directly, type
the name of the group after the colon, for example, news:rec.arts.cooking. News groups are
indexed by name. Within a group, the entries are indexed by thread.
To mark entries as read or unread, use the check box to the left of
the entry. All articles are passed through the HTML formatter, and
converted as appropriate (e.g., URLs are displayed as links).

<dt> <b>mailto:</b><dd>To send mail from HotJava, type,<br> mailto:
<em>subject/recipient's email address</em> in the "Document URL" text area. (You can omit 
the subject and the address and type them instead in the mail window.) Inside
the mail window, click the HTML box to indicate that the mail contains
HTML markup. HTML-aware mail readers will then run the text through
the HTML formatter before displaying it.  <p>To embed a mailto: URL in
HTML, type: <br>&lt;A href="mailto: <em>subject/recipient's email
address"&gt;</em>&lt;/a&gt;. It will look like this (for example). <a
href="mailto:HotJava is awesome!/ java@java.sun.com"><em>java@java.sun.com</em></a>.

<dt> <b>FTP Browsing:</b><dd> You can browse FTP directories. When you click
on an FTP URL, HotJava displays the file icons in the window. Click
on the file you want. If HotJava recognizes the file type it
displays the file. If it does not recognize file type, it pops up a
window allowing you to save the file.

</dl> 
<p><dt><b><a name=open></a>Easy to Request URLs</b> <dd>You can type directly into the Document URL window
and hit Return. (Follow this link for more information on <a href="#URLs>URLs</a>.)

<p><dt><b><a name=documentation></a>
Complete, Fully-Indexed, On-Line Documentation</b><dd>The <a href="../doc/index.html">documentation page</a> contains
links to all documentation for the HotJava browser and the Java
language. The Java Search Tool, accessed from the Help menu, supports text searches on the documentation.

<p><b> <dt><a name=lists>Several URL List Managers</b><dd>
<dl>
<dt><b>History List</b><dd>The <a href="#history">History list </a>displays every URL you have visited during the current HotJava session. You can select a URL and revisit it.
<dt><b>Hotlist</b><dd>The <a href="#hotlist">Hotlist </a>is a place to store URLs you would like to revisit. Future releases will provide the capability to maintain multiple hotlists.
<dt><b>Goto List</b><dd>The <a href="#goto">Goto list</a> is a place holder for a list of URL accessible directly from the menu bar. This is a good place to store a short list of frequently visited URLs.
</dl>
</dl>

<h1><a name=howto></a>How to Use HotJava</h1>

<h2><A name=hints>Helpful Hints</a></h2>
<b>To open a new URL</b> 
you can type directly into the "Document URL" text field at the top of the screen and hit Return.<p>
<b>To stop fetching a URL</b> click on the Back button or fetch a new URL.<p>

If you have selected <b>delayed image or applet loading </b>from the HotJava Options menu, take a look at the <a href="#status">status icons </a>that support it.<p>
For the alpha release of HotJava, text in the Document URL field is selectable but text in the display window is not.

<h2><a name=BMI></a>Buttons, <a href="#menus"></a>Menus, and <a href="#icons""></a>Icons</h2>


<h3>HotJava Buttons</h3>

<h3>HotJava Menus<a name=menus></a></h3>
<dl>
<h3>File</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><b>Open...</b> <dd>Displays a window in which you can type the text for a URL. To specify a new URL, you can also type directly into HotJava's "Document URL" text area.
	<dt><b><a name=reload>Reload</b><dd>Reloads the current page. This is useful if you have made changes to the current HTML  source. You can also click on the Reload button at the bottom of the display.
	<dt><b>Print...</b> <dd>Brings up the Print window. You can send output to a printer or a file.
	<dt><b>View Source...</b> <dd>Opens a window in which the HTML markup text for the current page is displayed. You can save the HTML text to a file. The window contents do not change when the URL changes, enabling you to open multiple View Source windows. Follow this link for more information on <a href="#HTML">HTML</a>.
	<dt><b>Quit</b><dd>Exits HotJava.
	
</dl>	

<h3>Options</h3> <dl> <dt><a
name=security_options><b>Security...</b><dd>Opens a dialog box in
which you can specify the level of security to be applied to incoming
executable content.  The dialog provides options for security mode: No
access, Source only, Firewall, or Unrestricted. It also provides
access to options to configure your firewall. <p>For information on
HotJava security see <a
href="../doc/SecurityDialogHelp.html">Configuring HotJava
Security</a>. For information on configuring your firewall see <a
href="../doc/FirewallHelp.html">Configuring the Firewall List</a>.<p>

	<dt><b>Properties...</b><dd>Opens a dialog box which lets you change the HotJava Properties. For those properties with buttons, turn them on and off by selecting them. When text fields are displayed, you can type directly into them. To turn them off, delete the contents of the text field.

<h4>Firewall Proxy</h4>
This is the hostname and port number of a local proxy server.

<h4>FTP Proxy</h4>

This is the hostname and port number of an http proxy to use for all
FTP URLs. Whennot set, $browser connects directly to the host
specified in the URL. 

<h4>Caching Proxy</h4>
Specify a caching proxy when you are using a caching server and you want all requests to go through that caching server. If the caching server is also a firewall server, as it is at Sun, then it will be the only server used. <b>Important Note:</b> When Caching Server is "on," ALL requests are attempted through the caching server only. HotJava supports NCSA 1.3.A and CERN 3.0 proxy servers.<p>

In the Properties sheet you can specify where each of these servers is, as well as the port under which they are to be used. By default, HotJava tries to connect directly to the machine specified in the URL. If that fails, and the Firewall Proxy button has been selected, HotJava will try again to connect to the host, this time using the Firewall Proxy.

<h4>Read Path/Write Path</h4>
Restriction on which directories may be accessed is controlled through two access control lists (ACLs). Any attempt to open a file for reading while executing an applet is first checked against the HOTJAVA_READ_PATH for permission to access the directory which contains the file. <p>

Write accesses while in an applet are similarly checked against HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH. These two ACLs may not be modified from the Properties sheet. You may only set their value when HotJava first starts up by setting the environment variables HOTJAVA_READ_PATH and HOTJAVA_WRITE_PATH. WRITE_PATH is disabled for the alpha2 release but will be enabled for future releases.

<h4>Underline Anchors</h4>
Selecting this option causes the HTML anchors to be underlined.
<h4>Delay image/applet loading</h4>
Selecting this option stops HotJava from immediately loading all images/applets when you first visit a page. Instead, you can load them selectively  by clicking on them individually. This option is useful for slow connections.


	<p><dt><b>Flush Cache</b><dd>Flushes any images and audio cached by HotJava. This is useful if you have changed an image on disk and want to reload it.
	</dl>

<h3>Navigate</h3>
	<dl>

<h3><a name=status><a name=icons></a>Status Icons for Image and Applet Loading</h3></a>
HotJava provides feedback on the state of an image or applet as it is being loaded. If you have specified Delayed Image or Applet Loading in your HotJava Properties sheet, HotJava indicates the status of the image or applet so that you are better informed before making the decision to load it.  These icons appear where the image would be displayed.  They also provide some loading options, as follows:<p>

<dl>
<dt><img src="../demo/images/still-loading.gif"> <b>Still Loading</b>
<dd>Image or applet is still being loaded.
<dt><img src="../demo/images/delayed-image.gif"> <b>Delayed Image Loading</b><dd>You have selected Delayed Image Loading. When you click on this icon the image is loaded.

<dt><img src="../demo/images/delayed-image-ref.gif"><b>Delayed Image Loading with Reference</b>
<dd>If you click on the arrow, HotJava loads the page associated with the image. If you click anywhere else in the icon, HotJava loads the image.

<dt><img src="../demo/images/delayed-applet.gif"><b>Delayed Applet Loading</b>
<dd>You have selected Delayed Applet Loading. When you click on this icon, the applet is loaded.
<dt><img src="../demo/images/failed-loading.gif"> <b>Failed Loading</b><dd>An error occurred while loading the image or applet.
<dt><img src="../demo/images/failed-image-ref.gif"> <b>Failed Delayed Image Reference</b><dd>You have selected Delayed Image Loading. The image HotJava is attempting to load has both an image and a page reference. HotJava could not find the image.
</dl>
</dl>

<h2><a name=errors>Responding to Error Messages</h2>
<dl>
</a><b><dt>Out of memory</b> <dd>If you receive this message when trying to fetch a URL, restart HotJava. (This is a limitation  that will be fixed in the next release.)<p>

<b><dt>Can't find foo.bar<dd> </b>(Where foo is a class.) You need to
explicitly import the class that Java  can't find.
