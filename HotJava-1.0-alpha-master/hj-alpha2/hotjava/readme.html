<b>Version 1.0 alpha2</b> 


<h1>README</h1>
<p>
HotJava(tm) is a prototype of a World-Wide Web browser with the unique
feature that it displays "executable content" written in the
Java programming language.
The primary goal of this <b>alpha</b> release is to provide some examples
of executable content.
We hope these demos help you to visualize the potential of truly dynamic
Web browsing such as "live" information, interactive shopping, and
intelligent agents.

<p>
This is an <b>alpha</b> release.
We expect future releases will contain additional core functionality.
We also anticipate that some of the programming interfaces may change.
See <a href="doc/compatibility/compatibility.html">HotJava Applet 
Compatibility</a> for more information.
We invite your feedback to help guide our future development.
Send comments and bug reports to <i>java@java.sun.com</i>.


<p>
As an <b>alpha</b> release,  many future capabilities
are not yet implemented.
For example, while we've implemented the HTML specification, other Web
browsers (such as Mosaic and Netscape) accept ill-formed HTML documents
which HotJava may not yet understand.
Also, some security features, most notably public-key encryption, are not
implemented in this release.
This is a Solaris/SPARC release. Ports to Windows and the Macintosh are underway
and will be included in a subsequent release.

<p>
If you expect to make serious use of this technology, we urge
you to contact us at <i>java@java.sun.com</i> so we can  keep you informed of
developments that may impact your work.

<p>
