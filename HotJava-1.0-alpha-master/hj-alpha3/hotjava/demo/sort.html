<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
<hr>

We all know that Quicksort is one of the fastest algorithms for
sorting.  It's not often, however, that we get a chance to
see exactly <EM>how</EM> fast Quicksort really is.
The following applets, inspired by 
the algorithm animation work at
<A href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/>Brown University</a>,
chart the progress of three common sorting algorthms while
sorting the same set of data.  
<P>
<em>Click on each applet to see the algorithm run.</em>
