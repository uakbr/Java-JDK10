#    STOP - THIS SCRIPT AND HOTJAVA WILL NOT RUN AT ALL UNDER
#    SUNOS4.X, AKA SOLARIS 1.X.  
#
#    The problem is not with the shell used the run this script -
#    the binary software will simply not run at all under Sunos
#    4.x.  I am sorry if you missed earlier warnings and have
#    downloading this software expecting it to run on SUNOS 4.x.  A
#    port to the SUNOS 4.x platform is underway and will be
#    publically released as soon as we have it available.  For the
#    latest information see our home page at http://java.sun.com/
