/*
 * Type codes  6/12/91

	This typecode system allows us to represent the type
	of scalars in a uniform way. For instance, all integer types
	have some bits in common, and are distinguished by a built-in
	size field. Types without multiple sizes don't have a size field.

	Scalars may only have sizes which are powers of 2. The size
	field holds the log-based-2 of the object's size.

	All run-time types can be encoded in 4 bits. There are more
	compile- time types. These fit in 5 bits.
	Schematically, we have:
		+----+----+----+----+----+
		| c  |    t    |    s    |
		+----+----+----+----+----+

		Encoding is:
		   c   t  s	type
		-------------------------
		   0  00 00	unassigned
		   0  00 01	array
		   0  00 10	class
		   0  00 11	proxy    (OBSOLETE)
		   0  01 00	boolean (1 byte)
		   0  01 01	char	(2 bytes)
		   0  01 1s	float (single=1; double=2)
		   0  1u xx	integer (byte=0; short=1; int=2; long=3;
					 u=1 => unsigned)

			For runtime types, the size of an object
			is 1<<(t&3)

		   1  00 00	typedef	(compiler only)
		   1  00 01	void	(compiler only)
		   1  00 10	func    (compiler only)
		   1  00 11	unknown (compiler only)
		   1  01 00     error   (compiler only)

	Char and Boolean are not int's because they need a different signature,
	so have to be distinguishable, even at runtime. We allow arrays
	of objects, arrays(?), booleans, char, integers, and floats.
	Note that the low-order two bits of all these gives the log of
	the size, except for arrays, of course.

	I would prefer not to have unsigned int in the language, but
	don't want to make that decision at this level. We could come up
	with a better encoding of boolean and char if there were no
	unsigned.

	The compile-only type values that could be confused with the 
	integer and float scalar types must not ever be used. Value 0 must
	not be assigned a runtime type, as this is used for some sleazy
	trickery in punning types and pointer. In fact, we even have a name
	for it.
