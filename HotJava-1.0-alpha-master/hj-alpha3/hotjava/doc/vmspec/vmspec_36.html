This chapter documents the Java class file format.  An important objective of Java as used in WebRunner is that alternative implementations of Java can exist and interact by sharing class files. For this to be possible, these Java implementations must precisely implement the design given here.  Elements of the design not covered by this document are not crucial to class file sharing and may be implemented as you choose.<P>
Please contact us directly with any questions about which design elements are essential to a modified or original Java implementation, or for help validating an Java implementation.<P>
