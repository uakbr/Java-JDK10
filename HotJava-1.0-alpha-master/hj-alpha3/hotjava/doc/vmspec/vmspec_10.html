<H1>Garbage Collected Heap</H1>

<HR>

The Java heap is the runtime data area from which class instances (objects) are allocated. The Java language is designed to be garbage collected -- it does not give the programmer the ability to deallocate objects explicitly. Java does not presuppose any particular kind of garbage collection; various algorithms may be used depending on system requirements.<P>
Java objects are always referred to and operated on indirectly, through handles. Handles may be thought of as pointers to areas allocated out of the garbage collected heap.<P>
