<P>
This document tells you how to create an <EM>applet</EM>
-- a program written in the Java language to run within HotJava --
and include it in an HTML page.
HotJava, like Mosaic and Netscape,
is a browser for the World Wide Web.
Because HotJava can execute applets,
it is more flexible than other browsers. 
Pages with applets can still be read
by browsers such as Netscape,
since those browsers simply ignore
the new tag that specifies the applet.

<Em>
If you're running HotJava,
then this little guy is waving at you
at the top of this page.
We supply the applet
that performs this animation.
(We also supply an applet
that plays sounds.)
</Em>

     (such as the animation and sound applets we provide)
     in an HTML page -- without programming.

<LI> You can go to a page that lets you quickly
     <A Href="StepByStep.html">create an applet</A>.
