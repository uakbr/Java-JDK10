<h1>Glossary of Terms</h1>
<dl>
<dt>abstract class
<dd>A class that should never be instantiated; only its subclasses should be instantiated. Abstract classes are defined so that other classes can inherit from them.
<p>
<dt>actual parameter list
<dd>The arguments specified in a particular method call. See also formal parameter list. <p>
<dt>alpha value
<dd>A value that indicates the opacity of a pixel.<p>
<dt>API
<dd>Application Programmer Interface. The specification of how a programming writing an application accesses the facilities of some object. Interfaces can be specified in the Java and C++ languages using classes. The Java language also has a special interface syntax that allows interfaces that are more flexible than classes.<p>

<dd>A collection of data items, all of the same type, in which each item's position is uniquely designated by an integer.<p>
<dt>ASCII
<dd>American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A standard assignment of 7-bit numeric codes to characters. See also Unicode.<p>
<dt>atomic
<dd>Refers to an operation that is never interrupted or left in an incomplete state under any circumstance.<p>
<dt>binary operator
<dd>An operator that has two arguments.<p>
<dt>bit
<dd>The smallest unit of information in a computer, with a value of either 0 or 1.<p>
<dt>bitwise operator

<dt>casting
<dd>Explicit conversion from one data type to another.<p>
<dt>class
<dd>In the Java language, a type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class variables and methods, as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class.<p>
<dt>class method
<dd>Any method that can be invoked using the name of a particular class. Class methods affect the class as a whole, not a particular instance of the class. Class methods are defined in class definitions. See also instance method. <p>
<dt>class variable
<dd>A data item associated with a particular class as a whole-not with particular instances of the class. Class variables are defined in class definitions. See also instance variable.  <p>
<dt>comment
<dd>In a program, explanatory text that is ignored by the compiler. In Java programs, comments are delimited using // or /*...*/.<p>
<dt>compilation unit
<dd>The smallest unit of Java code that can be compiled. In the current Java implementation, the compilation unit is a file.<p>
<dt>compiler
<dd>A program to translate source code into code to be executed by a computer. The Java compiler translates Java source code into Java bytecode. See also interpreter.<p>
<dt>compositing
<dd>The process of superimposing one image on another to create a single image.<p>

<dt>critical section
<dd>A segment of code in which a thread uses resources (such as certain instance variables) that can be used by other threads, but that must not be used by them at the same time. <p>
<dt>declaration
<dd>A statement that establishes an identifier and associates attributes with it, without necessarily reserving its storage (for data) or providing the implementation (for methods). See also definition.<p>

<dt>double precision
<dd>In the Java language specification, describes a floating point number that holds 64 bits of data. See also single precision.<p>
<dt>encapsulation
<dd>The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services. Instance variables and methods can be added, deleted, or changed, but as long as the services provided by the object remain the same, code that uses the object can continue to use it without being rewritten. <p>
<dt>exception

<dt>IP
<dd>Internet Protocol. The basic protocol of the internet. It enables the unreliable delivery of individual packets from one host to another. It makes no guarantees about whether or not the packet will be delivered, how long it will take, or if multiple packets will arrive in the order they were sent. Protocols built on top of this add the notions of connection and reliability.<p>
<dt>interpreter
<dd>A module that alternately decodes and executes every statement in some body of code. The Java interpreter decodes and executes Java bytecode. See also compiler, runtime system. <p>
<dt>JPEG

<dt>method
<dd>A function defined in a class. See also instance method, class method. <p>
<dt>Mosaic
<dd>A program that provides a simple GUI that enables easy access to the data stored on the internet. These may be simple files, or hypertext documents. It was written by a team at NCSA. The popularity of this program has caused its name to be frequently used as a generic term to refer to browsers of the world wide web.<p>

<dt>object oriented design
<dd>A software design method that models the characteristics of abstract or real objects using classes and objects.<p>
<dt>octal
<dd>The numbering system using 8 as its base, using the numerals 0-7 as its digits. In Java programs, octal numbers must be preceded with 0. See also hexadecimal.<p>
<dt>overloading
<dd>Using one identifier to refer to multiple items in the same scope. In the Java language, you can overload methods but not variables or operators.<p>
<dt>overriding

<dt>RPC
<dd>Remote Procedure Call. Executing what looks like a normal procedure call (or method invocation) by sending network packets to some remote host.
<dt>root
<dd>In a hierarchy of items, the one item from which all other items are descended. The root item has nothing above it in the hierarchy. See also hierarchy, class, package.<p>
<dt>scope
<dd>A characteristic of an identifier that determines where the identifier can be used. Most identifiers in the Java language have either class or local scope. Instance and class variables and methods have class scope; they can be used outside the class and its subclasses only by prefixing them with an instance of the class or (for class variables and methods) with the class name. All other variables are declared within methods and have local scope; they can be used only within the enclosing block.<p>
<dt>single precision
<dd>In the Java language specification, describes a floating point number with 32 bits of data. See also double precision.<p>
<dt>SGML
<dd>Standardized, Generalized Markup Language. An ISO/ANSI/ECMA standard that specifies a way to annotate text documents with information about types of sections of a document. For example "this is a paragraph" or "this is a title".
<dt>subclass
<dd>A class that is derived from a particular class, perhaps with one or more classes in between. See also superclass.<p>
<dt>superclass
<dd>A class from which a particular class is derived, perhaps with one or more classes in between. See also subclass.<p>
<dt>thread
<dd>The basic unit of program execution. A process can have several threads running concurrently, each performing a different job, such as waiting for events or performing a time-consuming job that the program doesn't need to complete before going on. When a thread has finished its job, the thread is suspended or destroyed. See also process.<p>
<dt>TCP/IP
<dd>Transmission Control Protocol based on IP. This is an internet protocol that provides for the reliable delivery of streams of data from one host to another.<p>
<dt>TLA
<dd>Three Letter Acronym.<p>
<dt>Unicode
<dd>A 16-bit character set defined by ISO 10646. <p>
<dt>URL
<dd>Uniform Resource Locator. A standard for writing a textual reference to an arbitrary piece of data in the WWW. A URL looks like "protocol://host/localinfo" where protocol specifies a protocol to use to fetch the object (like HTTP or FTP), host specifies the internet name of the host on which to find it, and localinfo is a string (often a file name) passed to the protocol handler on the remote host.<p>
<dt>variable
<dd>An item of data named by an identifier. Each variable has a type, such as int or Object, and a scope. See also class variable, instance variable, local variable.<p>
