<h1>HotJava Applet Compatibility</h1>

This page briefly describes the guarantees we give about
<em>upward compatibility</em> --
running applets without recompilation in future releases of 
<a href="using.html">HotJava</a>.

<h2>Java Versioning Support</h2>

<a href="../overview/java/index.html">Java</a> 
is a late-bound, dynamic language. All methods,
variables, and classes are resolved dynamically the first time
they are used.  Instance variables and methods can be added to
classes without recompiling any of the code that uses the class.  This makes
Java much less susceptible to API changes than statically linked
languages such as C and C++.

<p>We have been coding in Java since 1991 and the language is stable.
Both the 
<a href="../javaspec/javaspec_1.html">language specification</a> 
and the 
<a href="../vmspec/vmspec_1.html">binary class specification</a> 
are finished and stable. Any extensions of these specifications will be made
so that older classes will be upward compatible.

<h2>1.0Alpha1 to 1.0Alpha2 Compatibility</h2>

Alpha1 applets are upward compatible with the Alpha2 release of
HotJava. This means that most applets developed and compiled with the
Alpha1 release will run in the Alpha2 browser <em>without</em> recompilation.

<p>Note that we changed the language name from "O.A.K." to "Java",
which has affected some APIs. We have managed to maintain upward
compatibility despite these changes. The interpreter and the class
loader automatically upgrade Alpha1 applets to use the new naming
scheme.

<p>We have also made changes to some APIs. The components exposed to
Alpha1 applets have remained stable so that simple applets compiled
for the Alpha1 release continue to work in the Alpha3 browser.

<h2>1.0Alpha2 to 1.0Alpha3 Compatibility</h2>

Both Alpha1 and Alpha2 applets are upward compatible with the Alpha3
release of HotJava.
This means that most applets developed and compiled with the
Alpha1 or Alpha2 release will run in the Alpha3 browser <em>without</em> recompilation.
<p>

Many Alpha3 applets are downward compatible with the Alpha2 release of HotJava.
However, your applet won't run under Alpha2 if it uses classes or methods
that were added in Alpha3.
<p>

In particular, applets that rely on double-buffering won't run under Alpha2.
The <a href="changes.html">Changes Since the Last Release</a>
document describes how to write code that uses double-buffering if it's
available, but also works when double-buffering isn't available.

<h2>1.0Alpha3 to Beta Compatibility</h2>

<em>We are committed to keeping the impact of API changes to a
minimum. However, we do NOT guarantee complete upward
compatibility between the Alpha3 and Beta releases. We reserve
the right to make changes that will break upward compatibility.</em>

<p>We hope to make some major improvements and simplifications to
the HotJava APIs in the Beta release. This will unfortunately
mean that some or all Alpha3 applets will not run in the Beta release browser
without recompilation.

<p>This is the bottom line with regards to upward compatibility 
of Alpha3 applets:

<ul>
<li> Very simple Alpha3 applets may continue to
     work in the Beta release.
<li> Most Alpha3 applets will have to be recompiled to
     work with the Beta release.
<li> Some APIs used by Alpha3 applets will be extended and some
     code modifications will be required.
<li> Alpha1 applets will have to be recompiled
     and are likely to require code modifications. 
</ul>

There are certain things that you should avoid when 
<a href="../appguide/index.html">writing Applets</a>. 
Please stick to the APIs defined in the
<a href="../api/browser.Applet.html">Applet</a> 
class. Don't assume that the Applet's 
<a href="../api/browser.Applet.html#item">item</a> 
field will be available in future releases.
Don't rely on APIs that are not documented.

<h2>Anticipated Changes Between 1.0Alpha3 and Beta</h2>

We intend to implement a model-view architecture that will allow the
same page to be visible in more than one window. Simple applets won't
be affected; they will simply be asked to paint once in each window in
which they are visible.

<p>The applet API will be extended to allow applets to use the
model-view architecture. Applets will be able to have a "view" part as
well as a "model" part. Alpha3 applets are equivalent to the "model"
part of Beta applets.

<p>The 
<a href="../api/awt.html">AWT</a> 
(Abstract Window Toolkit) will be greatly
improved. The graphics API will be extended, the interface to image
manipulation will be improved, more components will be added, etc.

<p>The APIs for 
<a href="../api/browser.audio.html">audio</a> 
are likely to change. They
will be updated to support more than one audio format.

<p>This list is by no means complete. We hope to extend and improve the
HotJava functionality in many ways that won't affect applets
directly.

<h2>Upward Compatibility After the Beta Release</h2>

<em>We are fully committed to supporting the Beta release applet APIs
<b>indefinitely</b>. We realize that the stability of the APIs in a widely
distributed system like HotJava is of crucial importance to its
success.</em>
