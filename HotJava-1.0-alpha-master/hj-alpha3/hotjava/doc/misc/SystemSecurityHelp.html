<h1>Specifying the System Security Configuration</h1>

<p>

One of the problems with any security mechanism is that it won't
protect you if it isn't configured properly. Another problem is that
an organization may wish to impose a certain security policy and be
reasonably certain that the policy will be followed inside the
organization.<p>

To address these problems,
you can set up a system security configuration.
You do so by copying security files into a special directory.
The security files are the same as those
that are written by the dialogs for individual user security.
The difference is that users are
prevented from weakening the security specified in these files.
In effect, these files override the users' choices,
except for users who have specified a more restrictive security policy.
<p>

To set up your system security configuration,
complete the following steps:

<ol>
<li> Configure your personal security files using the normal dialogs.
<li> Create a directory called "security_config"
in the HotJava/Java installation directory.
(This directory is pointed to by the HOTJAVA_HOME environment variable.
It contains directories named demo, doc, and classes,
as well as the bin directory
that contains the hotjava and java executable files.)
<li> Copy the files "access_mode" and "firewall_hosts" from your
$HOME/.hotjava directory into the security_config directory.
</ol>
