<b>Version 1.0 Alpha3</b>

<h1>Changes Since the Last Release</h1>
The current (1.0 Alpha3) release of HotJava
fixes many bugs and adds some features.
This page lists the changes that you might notice.
First, it lists the changes that HotJava 
<a href="#User">users</a> might notice.
Then it lists the changes that only 
<a href="#Programmer">programmers</A> would notice.
If you want to see how the Alpha2 release differed from Alpha1, see
<a href="http://java.sun.com/1.0alpha2/doc/changes/changes.html>the
previous version of this document</a>.

<a name=User><h2>Changes Visible to HotJava Users</h2></A>

Details of the 1.0 Alpha3 changes to HotJava are listed below.
For information on how to use new and changed features,
refer to the 
<A Href="using.html">HotJava User's Guide</A>.
<P>

<ul>
<li> Added a STOP button.
     This button cancels the fetching of a page or image;
     it doesn't affect applets.
<li> Editable text fields now have white backgrounds.
<li> Buttons look different.
<li> Applets can now write to files, as determined by your write path.
     By default, the write path is empty.
     For security reasons, an applet won't be loaded from a filesystem
     that is writable by applets.
<li> Added an experimental version of a Progress Monitor (available through the
     Options menu).
<li> Implemented the gopher protocol.
<li> Changed the default font from 17 point to 14 point.
<li> User documentation updated to include new Alpha3 features.
     Also, the documentation hierarchy has been reorganized.
     The <a href="../index.html">Documentation Home Page</a>
     now has links to the latest draft documentation
     and to the user documentation.
<li> Mail composition and message posting dialogs now have a "From" field
     that lets you enter your e-mail address.
<li> The mail composition window has a "Cc" field.
<li> Submitting a form via a mailto URL causes a confirmation dialog to appear.
<li> News protocol handling works better now.
<li> Added suspend/resume feature to the ImageLoopItem applet.
     Click the applet's display area to suspend/resume the animation.
<li> When a documentation file doesn't exist on the user's system,
     HotJava now looks for the document under http://java.sun.com/1.0alpha3.
     (Last release, it looked under 1.0alpha2.)
     You can override which directory (instead of 1.0alpha3)
     HotJava looks under by setting the HOTJAVA_RELEASE environment variable.
</ul>

<a name=Programmer><h2>Changes Visible to Programmers</h2></a>
Details of the 1.0 Alpha3 changes are listed below.
For more details on the API,
refer to
<A Href="../api/packages.html">The Java Class API</A>.
For information about the Java language, refer to
<a href="../javaspec/javaspec_1.html">The Java Language Specification</a>.
For information on compatibility between releases, refer to
<a href="compatibility.html">HotJava Applet Compatibility</a>.
<P>

<ul>
<li> The Java Language Specification has been revised.
     It's now clearer, describes the new language features (listed below),
     and has a new appendix that formally describes the Java grammar.
<li> Java language changes:
     <ul>
     <li> Added a new declaration syntax for arrays,
          which makes it easier to declare a method that returns an array:
<pre>
int[] i;
int[] method();
</pre>
     <li>Both catch and finally are now allowed in a single try statement:
<pre>
try{...}catch(e){...}finally{...}
</pre>
     <li> Allow trailing ',' in static array initializers.
     </ul>
<li> Added double-buffering to allow you to improve animation performance.
     You do this by creating an image and drawing to it directly
     using a Graphics object.
     Double-buffering is NOT backwards compatibile --
     applets that use it can't be executed by the Alpha2 release of
     the HotJava browser.
     You can work around this with code such as the following:
<pre>
class MyApplet extends Applet {
    Image		im;
    Graphics	offscreen;

    public void init() {
    	...
    	resize(400, 500); // or whatever
    	...

    	try {
    	   im = createImage(width, height);
    	   offscreen = new Graphics(im);
    	} catch (Exception e) {
    	   // double-buffering not available
    	   offscreen = null;
    	}
    }

    public void paintApplet(Graphics g) {
    	... code to paint your applet ...
    }

    public void update(Graphics g) {
    	paint(g);
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
    	if (offscreen != null) { 
            // double-buffering available
	    paintApplet(offscreen);
	    g.drawImage(im, 0, 0);
	} else {
            // no double-buffering
	    paintApplet(g);
	}
    }

    public void destroy() {
    	if (offscreen != null) {
            offscreen.dispose();
	    im.dispose();
	}
    }
}
</pre>
<li> New font metrics interfaces (awt.FontMetrics).
     The metrics interfaces in awt.Font will go away in the beta release.
<li> javah has been changed, so that the process of writing native methods
     has been simplified.
     The javah man page has been updated to reflect these changes.  
<li> Made static initializer public so the URL class can be used from
     outside the net.www.html package.
<li> Date: deals with timezone-independent times; can deal with GMT.
<li> System: added a time-of-day method that actually works.
<li> Fixed Color class so you can initialize it without having
     a WServer object around. 
<li> Switched to dithering intensities instead of RGB on grayscale displays.
     This is a big improvement in image quality on mono and grayscale displays.
<li> Made Socket.connect method public (with some security checks of course).
<li> Improved support for doubles and long long's on machines that insist
     these be 8-byte aligned.
     (This change is visible only to porters.)
<li> Added support for binding a socket to any local address.
     Creating an InetAddress with a hostname of null means
     "any of the local machine's network addresses."
<li> Fixed a core dumper in the Date class.
<li> Fixed a javah bug that caused byte, char and short fields
     to be majorly messed up.
<li> Compiler/run-time fixes:
     <ul>
     <li> >>=, <<=, >>>= were not compiling properly for longs.
     <li> Compiler didn't like unused variables with array initialize.
     <li> Methods and ivars were confused.
     <li> String += object didn't work.
     <li> Wrapping code in a try-finally caused undefined variable error.
     <li> Null Pointer exception in compiler when compiling 0.0/0.0.
     <li> Class resolution deadlock.
     <li> Compiler didn't accept   0X1 and 0x1L.
     <li> javac not multi-thread safe.
     <li> Compiler did not insist that the package be the first thing
          in the file.
     </ul>
<li> Added the following classes and interfaces:
     <dl>
     <dt> In awt:
     <dd> FontMetrics

     <dt> In java.io:
     <dd> StringBufferPrintStream, StringInputStream, TextInputStream

     <dt> In java.util:
     <dd> BASE64Decoder, BASE64Encoder, BitSet, CRC16, Cache,
          CharacterDecoder, CharacterEncoder, HexDumpEncoder,
	  UCDecoder, UCEncoder, UUDecode, UUEncoder, CEFormatException,
	  CEStreamExhausted, EmptyStackException

    </dl>
</ul>
