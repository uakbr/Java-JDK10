You may bind any Java method to a C method. The way you indicate that a particular method is defined in C is by declaring the method native. In the sample application we define two Java classes with native methods: Inputfile.java and Outputfile.java.<P>

 * leverage the path manipulation code provided in the File

 * definitions for the JavaLinker object.  The Linker class 
 * gets loaded in by the import statment.  And the loadLibrary 
 * call that's used later in this class is a static method that 
 * operates on the global class and not a specific object 
 * instance.  Please refer to the Java language
 * specification for more information on static methods and

The three classes, File.java, InputFile.java, and OutputFile.java are compiled using javac to create the class files. The classes created by compiling InputFile.java and OutputFile.java are passed to javah to create header files and stub files. File.java contains no native methods and its compiled class does not need to be passed to javah. <P>
