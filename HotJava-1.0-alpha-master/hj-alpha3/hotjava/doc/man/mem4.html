<h1>mem4 - The HTML Macro Processor</h1>
 
<p>
<b>mem4</b> processes macros embedded in HTML files.
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
    java mem4 filename &gt outfile
</pre>
<P>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>mem4</b> is the HTML Macro Processor written in the Java language.
<P>
The <i>filename</i> argument is the name of a file that contains
special <b>mem4</b> macro directives embedded within HTML.
By default <b>mem4</b> writes its output to the standard output stream.
To cause <b>mem4</b> to write an output file instead, redirect its output to a file.
Although <b>mem4</b> doesn't require it, your input files should have a <i>.mem4</i> filename
extenstion, and your output files should have a <i>.html</i> filename extension.

<h2>MACROS</h2>
<h3>Defining a Variable</h3>
<b>mem4</b> let's you define and use variables.
To define a variable:
<pre>
    #define VARIABLE value
</pre>
When defining a variable:
<ul>
<li>
<i>#define</i> must appear as the very first thing on a line
<li>
<i>VARIABLE</i> is a string of any length that contains only alphanumeric characters
<li>
<i>value</i> is everything else on the line, trimmed of leading and
trailing whitespace.
<li>
<i>#define</i> is separated from <i>VARIABLE</i> with a space and
<i>VARIABLE</i> is separated from <i>value</i> with a space
</ul>

<h3>Using a Variable Definition</h3>
To use a variable:
<pre>
    $VARIABLE
</pre>
You can use a variable
<ul>
<li>
in the <i>value</i> of any definition that occurs after the variable
has been defined.
For example:
<pre>
    #define PATH /some/thing/blah/blah
    #define FILE $PATH/filename
</pre>
defines
<pre>
    PATH = /some/thing/blah/blah
    FILE = /some/thing/blah/blah/filename
</pre>
<li>
anywhere on a line. For example:
<pre>
    create a directory named $PATH
</pre>
yields
<pre>
    create a directory named /some/thing/blah/blah
</pre>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> you can redefine a variable simply by defining it again.

<b>Note:</b> if you really want the string $VARIABLE to be in the result
use '\' to escape the variable name. For example:
<i>$\VARIABLE</i> yields <i>$VARIABLE</i> in the output.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> if you reference a variable that has not been defined
the variable name is used as its value. For example, if VARIABLE
had not been defined, <i>$VARIABLE</i> would yield <i>VARIABLE</i>
in the output.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> you can't concatenate the value of a variable
with regular text. For example, if you use <i>$VARIABLEsometext</i>
<b>mem4</b> will actually look up <i>VARIABLEsometext</i> in its dictionary,
rather than concatenate the value of <i>VARIABLE</i> and the following text.
In other words the variable name must be followed by
a non-alphanumeric character that separates it from
whatever follows it.

<h3>Including Files</h3>
<b>mem4</b> let's you include the contents of other files.
To include a file:
<pre>
    #include filename
</pre>
When including files:
<ul>
<li>
<i>#include</i> must appear as the very first thing on a line.
<li>
<i>filename</i> is everything else on the line, trimmed of leading and
trailing whitespace.
<li>
<i>#include</i> is separated from <i>filename</i> with a space.
<li>
the included file can use variables defined within the current file
and can add definitions to the current dictionary.
<li>
the filename is either an absolute path, or relative to the
current directory.
</ul>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<p>
Need to allow users to concatenate a variable with regular text.
One possibility is to use the '\' character to separate
the variable name from the text, so that:
<i>$VARIABLE\sometext</i> yields <i>valuesometext</i>.

<h2>STAY TUNED FOR</h2>
<h3>#include features</h3>
Ability to extract lines from an included file.<br>
Ability to make certain lines from an include file bold.<br>
Ability to make certain lines from an include file italic.<br>
<h3>#undefine features</h3>
Ability to undefine variables.
